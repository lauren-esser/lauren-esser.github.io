Just because we are working with numbers and code, doesn't mean we need to have a boring Jupyter notebok. In this blog we will go over different ways to spice up your notebook and make it visually pleasing for your readers. Ready? Let's get started.

## The Basics
### Block Quotes
> This is how we create a block quote in jupyter notebook
> > If you would like a quote to be nested with your your block quote you can add one more greater than sign.
> > > Or if you REALLY wanted a nest within a nest you can add an additional greater than sign.

### Headings
There are six different options for headings. The more #'s there are the smaller the heading. See below.

### Hyperlinks
If you would like to add a hyperlink that doesn't show the entire weblink you can format the link where you click [here](www.google.com) to access the webpage. (I just linked mine to Google). Feel free to type in whatever words you would like in place of "here" and that is what will show up in your notebook.
