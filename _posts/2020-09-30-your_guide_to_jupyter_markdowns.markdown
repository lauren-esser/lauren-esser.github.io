Just because we are working with numbers and code, doesn't mean we need to have a boring Jupyter notebok. In this blog we will go over different ways to spice up your notebook and make it visually pleasing for your readers. Ready? Let's get started.

## The Basics
### Block Quotes
> This is how we create a block quote in jupyter notebook
> > If you would like a quote to be nested with your your block quote you can add one more greater than sign.
> > > Or if you REALLY wanted a nest within a nest you can add an additional greater than sign.

**Here's how it looks**

### Headings
There are six different options for headings. The more #'s there are the smaller the heading. See below.

**Here's how it looks**

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6


### Hyperlinks
If you would like to add a hyperlink that doesn't show the entire weblink you can format the link where you click [here](www.google.com) to access the webpage. (I just linked mine to Google). Feel free to type in whatever words you would like in place of "here" and that is what will show up in your notebook.

**Here's how you do it**

### Images
Notice all of the images in my blog? Well here is how I do it!

**I'd say here's how it looks, but just look above!** 

### Line Breaks
You have no idea how many times I have tried to make a line break only to hit shirt+enter and see no break whatsoever. Therefore, if you need a line break in your jupyter notebook markdown make sure to hit enter *two or more times*, depending on how large you would like the break.

*What NOT to do*

### Lists
Making lists is very similar to what you would do anywhere else. 

>Here is my unordered list:
- apples
- bananas
- oranges

But what if I wanted to list my favorite fruits in order?

>Here is my ordered list:
1. Oranges
2. Apples
3. Bananas
